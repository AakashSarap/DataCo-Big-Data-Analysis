# DataCo-Big-Data-Analysis

In this project, I have created a data ingestion pipeline to ingest product usage data from MySQL into HDFS using Sqoop & Flume on Cloudera in Microsoft Azure. I have also analyzed the transaction and web clickstream data using HIVE queries to discover revenue trends and product usage patterns and answers business questions like: What products do our customers like to buy? and What are the top ten revenue generating products?, etc.

## Approach

* Ingest and Query Relational Data
* Correlate Structured Data with Unstructured & Semi-structured Data (Web Clickstream data) 
* Relationship Strength Analytics using Spark

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Microsoft Azure
* Cloudera
* Apache Sqoop
* Apache Flume
* Hive (Hue & Impala)
* Apache Spark
